# Two Pointer technique
# Idea/pattern: Use two indices moving through data, usually to reduce O(n²) to O(n).
# Best for: Sorted arrays, pair problems, partitions, merging-like logic.

#start = 0
#end = len(s)-1

#while start <= end:
#    s[start] , s[end] = s[end] , s[start]
#    start +=1
#    end -=1

# print(s)
# This will raise error because string object is immutable
